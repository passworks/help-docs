<ol>
  <li>
    Client creates a campaign, this means:
    <ul>
      <li>Define campaign type (pass layout, eg: coupon, boarding pass, etc)</li>
      <li>Define the type of barcode to use, if any.</li>
      <li>Define the fields that will be used in the pass, customer seat, pass number, event date, etc..</li>
      <li>Se the basic look and feel of the campaign by defining the colors and uploading the assets, icon, banner, etc...</>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    After creating the campaign, the client calls the Passworks API, this time to create a pass for the customer.
    <ul>
      <li>Now suppling the required fields, usually customer specific fields, like name, seat, ticket number, etc</li>
    <ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    After the pass is created, now it's time to make it reach the customer, via:
    <ul>
        <li>E-mail: You can send the pass as a link in a newsletter or direct customer e-mail</li>
        <li>SMS: You can send the pass as a link to the customer</li>
        <li>Print flyer or brochure: You can print the pass install URL and have the customer scan it with is phone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Customer scans the Pass installation QrCode or click's the installation link.
  </li>

  <li>
    After the customer installs the pass the Client now can:
    <ul>
      <li>Send push message to all passes inside a given campaign or to a specific pass</li>
      <li>Menage life cycle of the pass, meaning that you can void it (making it un-scannable) in case of a redeem or simply delete the pass</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>View thew reporting information from the API or directly from the the Passworks interface, the advantage of the API is that allows you to create your own dashboard.</li>
  
</ol>
