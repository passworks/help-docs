> Remember, the *Android Pay* mobile passes creation is a *beta* feature, so many small features related
> to it may not be fully available yet.
>
> We're constantly improving the integration with Android Pay, especially the creation flow.
> So, if you find anything that is not working as expected, please let us know.

If you arrived here, you're probably about to create mobile passes targeted to the Android Pay platform.
In case you haven't yet fully understand the concepts, please see our
[Introduction to Android Pay]({% post_url 2016-06-02-introduction-android-pay %}) page and then return to the
creation process.


Aiming to give you a fast and practical way to create mobile passes for the Android Pay,
we've used the current Apple Wallet (formerly Passbook) flow to creating them, as you might know, the passes are
not visual maching, however the fields available follow the same structure.

In order to create mobile passes for Android Pay, just follow these steps:

## Choose a campaign type

Following the actual flow, the first action is to choose a campaign type. So far the supported
types are:

 * Coupon (Android Pay Offer)
 * Membership (Android Pay Loyalty)

 > Confused with the pass name and types? Check our [Pass Types]({% post_url 2016-06-07-android-style-passes %}) page with
 > the compatibility table.

After choosing one of these options, you should guarantee if the "Allow Android Pay" is
checked, as follows:

{:.image.retina.android}

*Figure 1 - New Campaign With Android Pay*

Give your campaign a descriptive name and click 'Next'

## Design Pass

The preview for the creation of a Android Pay template is not available yet, however, our
current flow to creating passes uses the preview for interacting and filling the pass template
and data. So you should, temporarily, interact with the Apple Preview for creating the fields.

> Remember: You don't have to limitate the pass creation by the visual on the preview.
> It's expecting a Apple Wallet (formerly Passbook) information (witch differs on field size limitations).
> So, don't worry about the look and feel here and focus on the final pass.
>
> It is worth reading the Android Pay documentation regarding the pass structure and how
> all this information is going to be rendered.

### Colors

In the first release of Google Wallet, it was possible to choose the pass colors
(background and text colors), however it was deprecated since the migration to Android Pay.

The pass color rendered at the devices will be retrieved from the *Icon* image you'll associate
with it. The algoright used try to figure the dominant color out and set it as background color.

> We'll son release the Android Pay *designer template creator* with the same algoright associated
> so as soon as you choose the icon's image, we'll check for the right color.

{:.image.retina.android}
![colors](/assets/images/android-colors.png)
*Figure 3 - Choosing colors*

### Headers

The *Notification Title* and *Logo Text* will be used as the pass title, if this information
is not defined, the *Campaign Name* and *Organization Name* will be used instead.


{:.image.retina.android}
![logo_text](/assets/images/android-logo-text.png)
*Figure 4 - Header Fields*

### Images

For the *Android Pay* passes, you can use an *Icon* and a *Strip Image*.

As mentioned before, the Icon is essencial as the pass color is defined based on this image and,
of course, it's your brand name here.

The strip image will be shown as the first item when navigatin to the pass detail.

> The strip image doesn't have a constraint ratio defined for its size, so very long images are allowed.
> Take care while choosing it.

## Pass Content


> Once again, it is worth reading the Android Pay documentation regarding the pass structure and how
> all this information is going to be rendered.

### Text fields

Right after the image, it may list a set of title/desctiption used for depict all the pass
information. As the current *template creator* can define multiple fields (at different positions)

We tried to order the fields the the *Android Pay* as they are currently defined
at the *Pass Designer*. The order is:

 * Header Fields
 * Primary Fields
 * Secondary Fields
 * Auxiliary Fields
 * Back Fields

All those fields are basicaly key/value and neither of those have restrictions about the title
or description text size.

{:.image.retina}
![fields](/assets/images/android-fields.png)
*Figure 6 - Text Fields*

### The links

The "backfields" have a special behaviour, here at *Android Pay* you have the *Links* session
where you can add links, phones or map points, we made it available through the "backfeields",
and for using it you simply have to use these references:

 * `http*` creates a link (title: link text, value: URL)
 * `*maps.google*` creates a pointer (title: pointer text, value: URL)
 * `tel:*` creates a link to a phone (title: link text, value: NUMBER)

> For more information check the [Android Pay UX References](https://developers.google.com/save-to-android-pay/reference/uxguidelines#linksmoduledata)

### Barcode

All barcode types we supported at Apple Wallet (Passbook) are also supported for Android. You can choose it
from the barcode selection area. The actual options are:

 * QrCode
 * Aztec
 * PDF417
 * Code 128

{:.image.retina.android}
![barcode](/assets/images/android-barcode.png)
*Figure 8 - Barcodes*

> Check our [Supported Barcodes]({% post_url 2016-01-02-supported-barcodes %}) page with a complete list and
> detailed information about each barcode type.


## Geolocation!

You can define up to 10 locations where a notification is going to pop at the holder's device.

{:.image.retina}
![locations](/assets/images/android-locations.png)
*Figure 9 - Adding Locations*

> Remember: There is no support for *Push Notifications* at the Android Pay.

Even without push notifications, the users are informed that they are nearby a pass' merchant
here is how it'll be shown on user's device:

{:.image.retina}

*Figure 12 - Notification preview*


> Remember: There is no support for *Beacons* at the Android Pay

## Publish & Install

After filling all the information, just publish the campaign and you'll something like this:

{:.image.retina}
![android-waiting.png](/assets/images/android-waiting.png)
*Figure 13 - Notification preview*

At this very moment, our service will start to synchronize the pass information with the
*Android Pay* Servers.

> The synchronization may take some moments to be done, at this time you wont be able
> to install the passes on the *Android Pay*.

You can reload the page and check the status:

{:.image.retina.android}
![sync-done](/assets/images/android-sync-done.png)
*Figure 14 - Sync done*

It's done, now you can share your distribution link or passes and the users can install it to
theirs Android Pay App.

#### Errors

If any kind of error happen, a link for trying another sync should appear. Our tech team will
probably be notified in advance.

### Distribution

> Remember: The download pages for *Distribution* and *Pass* are the same. The only difference is
> that at the Distribution page, when a user clicks for download the Apple Wallet pass, it
> creates a new pass and then push it to the user.

As the instalation of the pass to the user's *Android Pay* app is managed by Google,
the pass should be created before displaying the *Save To Pay* button. At this point the pass
is not created yet, so is first shows a "I have Andodroid Pay"

{:.image.retina.android}
![i-have-wallet](/assets/images/android-i-have-wallet.png)
*Figure 15 - Default distribution page*

{:.image.retina.android}
![i-have-wallet-android](/assets/images/android-i-have-wallet-android.png)
*Figure 16 - Anrdoid distribution page*

Right after the user clicks at the button, the pass then will be created and the button should
change to "Save to Pay"

### Passes

The user will either click at the "I have Android Pay" button or follow a direct link and then
click at the "Save to Pay" button fot actually installing the pass to its *Android Pay* app.

{:.image.retina.android}

*Figure 17 - Save To Pay Default Page*

### Google Accounts

As mentioned on the [Introduction]({% post_url 2016-06-02-introduction-android-pay %}), in order to install
the pass you must have a Google Account.

{:.image.retina.android}
![save-to-pay-credentials](/assets/images/android-save-to-pay-credentials.png)
*Figure 18 - Google Account Required*

> If you're not logged into any Google Account, the popover will give all the instructions
> to login and then install the pass.


After the pass get really installed, the button will tell you so and suggest you either
get the app or directly show it if you are using a device with Android Pay app installed.

## Updating passes & Campaigns

Right after you publish the campaign update, we will notify the Android Pay services with
the updates and it will automatically be updated on the user's devices.
