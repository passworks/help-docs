description: Single sign-on (SSO) using SAML
---

Passworks supports [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) for single sign-on (SSO).

To setup and configure single sign-on access on the Passworks Platform you need be logged in with *owner account* user, this is the account of the first user that created the Passworks account, that person is considered the owner and his account is the only one that is allowed to setup and configure the SSO permissions (there is only one owner per account).

Go to [Users & Permissions](https://passworks.io/organizations/roles) &#x2192; [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://passworks.io/sso/saml) to enabled the SSO for your organization.

    <td>
      Here you can see on the footer of the image that the user is the "Owner", this is the role assigned to the current user.
